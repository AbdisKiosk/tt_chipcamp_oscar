## How it works
The system calculates a sequence of numbers based on the value entered by the user. It ensures all numbers in the sequence remain within 8-bit range (0–255) and does not use any external hardware. Processing is all done internally and only results fitting the 8-bit limit are valid.

## How to test
Test by entering any number so that the calculated sequence stays within the 8-bit range. For example, choose numbers whose sequence never exceeds 255. Observe the result and verify that outputs conform to the 8-bit limitation to confirm correct functionality.

## External hardware
No external hardware is required for operation or testing.
